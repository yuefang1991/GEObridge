Introduction","title":"GEObridge -- an R package to connect the GEO database and researcher","text":"Data Science (DS) becoming important recently everyone already feels . Data analysis infiltrated every industrial academic field including news, sport, biopharma, big tech, precision medicine. Specifically, precision medicine looks genetics, disease environment, diet person order select treatment work best patient, significantly dependent large-scale sequencing data. National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) released public repository, named Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [2-4], high-throughput molecular abundance experiment data, providing free distribution shared access comprehensive datasets. Till 10/26/2022, GEO contains 216,550 datasets 4,446,632 samples covering Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, organisms. number datasets accumulated GEO, downloading querying data GEO database became difficult problem due large scale category complexity . lot methods tools developed last two decades solve urgent issue satisfy unmet needs different user groups including bioinformaticians, doctors without coding experience, biologists focus cancer immunotherapy development, . GEOquery one popular outstanding R package enable user download sequencing data GEO database access ID references [1]. package available Bioconductor platform well GEOmetadb [5]. GEO data browser [6] official tool GEO database similar internal search engine inside GEO database. However, manual searching thousands datasets millions samples enough heavy labor research topic. Thus, GEO metadb becomes useful tool mining data GEO. GEOmetadb one popular R packages among -mentioned R packages due powerful search function clear data storage structure based Structured Query Language (SQL). However, existing tool enables analysis downloaded table using GEOmetadb R package. Specifically, existing R function search analyze queried table summary category based interested platform organism GEO database. , proposed develop novel R package named GEObridge solve pain points users whose work benefit R package. challenge 1 Many Categories Popped Searching Keyword One advantage GEO database complete information biggest database public domain. hand, also brings issue many categories returned using searching function. let user feel overwhelmed know scale dataset. One solution issue provide filter function parameter. help filter, user can filter non-interested information complex categories. example, searching function can return platforms (e.g. microarray, bulk RNA-seq, etc.) user cares top 5 popular platforms. user can set filter parameter 5 remove less frequency platform returned search result. challenge 2 Long Waiting Time Search Function Another challenge faced package development search process slow. researching little bit issue, turns current SQL-based query method already efficient way extract information large table. Meanwhile, also learned knowledge time complexity memory complexity computer science major since courses mentioned related terminology. reduce time complexity, common way computer science increase memory complexity. Thus, solution issue prepare result frequently used function advance saved package. challenge 3 user-friendly visualization method public available Even two points can solved package, user still want find way visualize result can used publication. also help user get better understanding GEO dataset meta information. , make two functions solve challange. first plot function draw barplot frequent platform summaried download database. user can select number frequent parameter top 5 top 10 platforms. second function draw barplot interactive way. user can select interested platforms draw barplot dynamically thanks power RShiny gadget. user can use mice click select several platforms show right panel instantly. vignette GEObridge R package. vignette, use four examples demostrate utility feasibility proposed R package. proposed GEObridge package use several functions GEOmetadb package query full meta information GEO database. , illustrate important proposed R package showing four examples.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://yuefang1991.github.io/GEObridge/articles/vignettes.html","id":"user-friendly-searching-function-for-digging-more-detailed-information","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"GEObridge -- an R package to connect the GEO database and researcher","title":"GEObridge -- an R package to connect the GEO database and researcher","text":"primary goal GEObridge package build R package depends GEOmetadb package provides user-friendly functions dig information downloaded table.
